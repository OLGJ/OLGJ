# 👋 Hi, I'm Olof 👋

## I am currently studying my master's degree in Statistics & Machine learning. But as a side note I enjoy improve my codingskills!

In my profile you'll find some projects I've been working on, check them out! I can recommend [S-A_Vader][vader], my bachelor thesis where I conducted semantic analysis on comments regarding stocks from wallstreetbets, and how this relates to traded volume.
